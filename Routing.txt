React Native Uses Page Router

Anything created inside app is treated as route 

For example :

app/about.jsx

about.jsx is a route or navigation in react Native


The below command can be used for a expo routing 
`bash
cd app
touch about.jsx 
`

inside about.jsx create a react native export function 
`bash
rnfes
`

inside  index.jsx create add a Link tab :
`bash
<Link href={'/about'}>
About
</Link>
`

also import the Link tag from expo-Router

and when you click on About you will be redirected to the about page boom
